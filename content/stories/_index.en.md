The latest software developed at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hug-ge.ch/">University Hospital of Geneva (HUG)</a> for medical imaging is Weasis which is the clinical viewer in the home-made Electronic Medical Records. Since 2010 it is an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nroduit/Weasis/">open source project</a> distributed either as a WEB application or as a multi-platform portable application (about 50â€™000 downloads in 2017 for the portable version).

The University Hospital of Geneva has a long history of medical imaging sofware. Starting in 1990 at HUG, Osiris was the first radiological imaging viewer freely distributed and then in 2003 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.osirix-viewer.com/about/story/">OsiriX</a> was the Mac successor to Osiris.
